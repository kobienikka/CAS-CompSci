What keyword does Swift use to mark the definition of a function? (Think like def in Python and function in JavaScript.)
- func

How do you declare the type of value that a function returns?
- "You indicate the functionâ€™s return type with the return arrow -> (a hyphen followed by a right angle bracket), which is followed by the name of the type to return."

How could you use argument labels to help clean up your code or make it more readable?
- there more specific the name the clearer the code will be.
